# Gopher v2.0 Demo: Go, Alpine.js, & Tailwind CSS

This project is a minimal, production-ready web application that demonstrates the Gopher v2.0 architecture. It features a Go backend serving a simple HTML page styled with Tailwind CSS and made interactive with Alpine.js.

All frontend assets are embedded into the final, single Go binary for easy deployment. This project resides within the `web/gopher-v2-demo/` directory of the parent `golang` repository.

## Core Architecture

- **Backend**: Go (`net/http`, `chi` router)
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js for interactivity, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Templating**: Go's `html/template` package.
- **Assets**: Go's `embed` package for bundling.
- **Logging**: Go's `slog` for structured JSON logging.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed on your system. This project is optimized for **macOS (ARM64)**.

1. **Go**: Version 1.21 or newer.
2. **Node.js & npm**: Required for the Tailwind CSS build step.

## Local Development Workflow

Follow these steps exactly to build and run the application after cloning the parent repository.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the entire `golang` repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/golang.git
cd golang
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory

All subsequent commands must be run from within this specific project's directory.

```sh
cd web/gopher-v2-demo
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies & Build Assets

This project uses `npm` to manage the Tailwind CSS build process. The following commands will install the necessary dependencies and then compile the project's CSS.

```sh
# Install Node.js packages defined in package.json
npm install

# Run the build script to compile web/assets/input.css -> static/output.css
npm run build
```

This generates the `static/output.css` file required by the Go application. The `static/alpine.v3.min.js` file is already included in the repository.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Go Application

Now, build the final, single Go binary. The `go build` command compiles the Go code and embeds the entire `static` directory into the executable.

```sh
# Ensure Go dependencies are up-to-date
go mod tidy

# Build the binary
go build -o gopher-demo .

# Run the application
./gopher-demo
```

### Step 5: View the Application

You will see a JSON log message in your terminal confirming the server is running:

```json
{
  "time": "2025-06-18T17:00:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "Starting server",
  "addr": ":3000"
}
```

Open your web browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to see the running application.
